Argon2 Password Hash

This Zig program derives a cryptographic key from a password and salt using the Argon2id password hashing algorithm. It uses [std.crypto.pwhash.argon2] to hash a salted password, where the salt should be generated using to ensure randomness. The salt in the example is hardcoded to write the test.
